     * Task: Euclidâ€™s algorithm (which is over two thousand years old)
     * computes the greatest common divisor of two numbers as gcd(a, b) = a if b is zero,
     * and gcd(b, rem(a, b)) otherwise, where rem is the remainder.
     * Clearly, the gcd should not be negative, even if a or b are (since its negation would then be a greater divisor).
     * Implement the algorithm with %, floorMod, and a rem function that produces the
     * mathematical (non-negative) remainder.
     * Which of the three gives you the least hassle with negative values?
     *
